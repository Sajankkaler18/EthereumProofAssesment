MyToken
Definition
MyToken is a custom Solidity ERC-20-like token. It can mint and burn tokens, while using public variables to store the name,
abbreviation, and total supply of the token. This contract has a mapping for addresses with their balances of tokens.

Requirements
Public Variables:

tokenName: The name of the token.

tokenAbbrv: The abbreviation of the token.

totalSupply: Token’s total supply.

Mapping:

balances: Stores addresses as well as their respective balances on tokens.
Mint Function:

Takes an address and a value as parameters.

Increases the total supply by that value.

As such, increases the balance of specified address by same amount.

Burn Function:

Takes an address and a value as parameters.

Makes sure that specified amount isn’t greater than or equal to balance at specified address to be burnt .

Henceforth, reduces total supply by this amount..

In doing so, it also reduces balance at the specified address by the same volume.
Execution Process
